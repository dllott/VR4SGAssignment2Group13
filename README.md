Description of the Project
Our experience puts the user in the perspective of an individual diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes who is financially struggling to balance insulin and food. Both of these are necessary in order to survive, therefore, causing the users to pick and choose between them resulting in the "disparity" aspect of the project. Throughout this experience, the user will have to go to work, sleep, eat and buy insulin in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, however, it proves to be harder than it seems.

We hope our project proved to be entertaining and educational to our audience and gives insight to the life of an individual diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes.

Unity version used for building the project: 2018.3.3.

We built our project for use on Google Cardboard.
